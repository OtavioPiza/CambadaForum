## About the Project
This project is an online forum similar to Reddit, which I created during the summer break of 2020 for my friends and me. It used a PostgreSQL server to store the contents of the website and was build using Java 8.

Current functionality includes:
- Registering a new user
- Logging-in 
- Creating new topics
- Editing old topics
- Commenting on topics
- Viewing the user ranking based on activity

Currently, I am working on:
- Stylizing the forum
- Adding the possibility to befriend users
